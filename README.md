# Lua version manager
This is a simple manager for Lua, allowing me to hot-swipe between versions easily.
As it also supports managing versions for LuaRocks as well.

The only dependency is [argparse](https://github.com/mpeterv/argparse), and should run using Lua >= 5.4.

This project is a personal project that fits my exact needs,
  since most managers for Lua only works on Linux, or shell dependent.
So do not expect any issues/PRs to be accepted,
  though if you think that you need to open an issue, or request a PR, that would be welcomed (just *might* not be accepted.)
